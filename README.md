# Traffic Intersection Simulation

## Basic Traffic Intersection Simulation (No AI)
This scenario features a 4-way traffic intersection with static green times for each direction. The next green light is determined based on a predefined sequence. Vehicles move according to the signals and the vehicles around them.

## Traffic Intersection Simulation with AI (Static Green Times)
In this scenario, an AI model analyzes the number of cars per direction. The AI determines the next green direction, but the green time remains static. Vehicles still follow the predefined sequence.

## Advanced Traffic Intersection Simulation (Variable Green Times)
Building upon the previous scenario, this version introduces variable green times. The green time for the next light is influenced by various factors, such as traffic density, time of day, and emergency vehicles. The AI adapts the green time dynamically based on these variables.
